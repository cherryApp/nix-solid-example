That's a very thoughtful observation, and you're not alone—**many developers initially feel that applying the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) leads to class explosion or unnecessary complexity**. Let's clarify when and why you'd actually split responsibilities into separate classes versus just organizing methods better within a single class.

---

## 🔍 Is SRP about splitting everything into classes?

**No, SRP is not about “one method per class.”**
SRP is about having **one reason to change**. The key is identifying _cohesive responsibilities_ that evolve independently.

### ✅ It's perfectly fine to keep multiple methods in a class **if they serve the same responsibility**.

## 🧪 Refined Example: Better Method Segregation Inside One Class

Let's take your original class and _improve it without immediately splitting it into multiple classes_, assuming the responsibilities are still closely related.

```csharp
public class Report
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Content { get; set; }

    public void ExportTo(string format, string path)
    {
        if (format == "PDF")
        {
            ExportAsPdf(path);
        }
        else if (format == "HTML")
        {
            ExportAsHtml(path);
        }
    }

    private void ExportAsPdf(string path)
    {
        // Logic for exporting as PDF
    }

    private void ExportAsHtml(string path)
    {
        // Logic for exporting as HTML
    }
}
```

👉 This is still **one class**, and the logic is **segregated by private methods** for clarity.
You're respecting cohesion, and it's readable, testable, and SRP-aligned **if the export logic is tightly tied to the concept of a report**.

---

## 💡 When Should You Break It Into Separate Classes?

Split responsibilities when:

1. **Export logic** needs to change often or grow independently.
2. You plan to support **dozens of formats** (PDF, HTML, Excel, JSON).
3. You want to **test** or **reuse** export logic separately from `Report`.
4. You're applying **Open/Closed Principle** (easy to extend without modifying).

In that case:

```csharp
public interface IReportExporter
{
    void Export(Report report, string path);
}

public class PdfReportExporter : IReportExporter { ... }
public class HtmlReportExporter : IReportExporter { ... }
```

Then `Report` itself has _no exporting logic_, which could be a cleaner architecture **for larger systems**.

## ✅ Rule of Thumb

| Scenario                             | SRP-Compliant Design               |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Small app or script                  | One class, well-segregated methods |
| Growing complexity or changing logic | Split into cohesive classes        |
| Separate team ownership or lifecycle | Split by responsibility            |

---

### 📌 Bottom Line

> You don't _have to_ split classes unless the responsibilities **truly diverge**. Use common sense and context: SRP is a **guiding principle**, not a rigid rule.

Would you like a practical example that compares a small-scale vs large-scale SRP refactor?
